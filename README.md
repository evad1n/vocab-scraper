# Vocab Scraper

Just a tool to automate finding definitions for large amounts of words and converting them to formatted JSON output.

Personally used for importing new words into [Lexicogn](https://github.com/evad1n/lexicogn)

## Features

- Populate definitions for a list of words, in JSON output
- Combine multiple files (txt/json) into a single list of unique words

Can be used interactively or as a library

## Functions

The define package contains methods for scraping definitions for a word from various sites. These can easily be turned into deployable serverless functions for an on-demand custom dictionary API.
